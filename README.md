# Tetris 
We were given code by an instructor and was instructed to create a GUI out of it. 

# The Theme
We were allowed to be as creative as possible with our theme. I originally wanted to make the blocks look like bricks, but I realized that having a horror aspeect and utilizing the pop up windows would fit better and more creatively. 
For example, I had the Annabelle doll from the conjuring series pop up whenever the user paused asking "Why did you pause?"
